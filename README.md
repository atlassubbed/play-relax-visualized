### what's the app?

This is a basic todo app built with Relax and Munchlax. You can add/remove items, clear all items, change the sort order, etc. This functionality demos what happens to the VDOM when you update, mount, unmount and move nodes.

### what's on the canvas?

The canvas renders the todo list, but in graph form. Go ahead and play around with the list and see the graph structure of the app change in real-time. Note that the tree is in [LCRS form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-child_right-sibling_binary_tree). All that means is that instead of a parent node storing pointers to all of its children, it only points to its first child, which in turn points to the next sibling, etc.

### â˜  mobile â˜ 

I haven't bothered tuning the canvas stuff for mobile. Check it out if you're on desktop Chrome. Ye be warned.
